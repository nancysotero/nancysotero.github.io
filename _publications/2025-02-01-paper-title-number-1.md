excerpt: 'Since the EMREO generation involves the two middle ear muscles, whose tension can alter sound transmission, we expected spatial sound discrimination performance to vary with the state of the ERMEO at the time of sound presentation. We contrasted perceptual sensitivity, bias, and reaction times for targets presented during either positive/negative or during small/large EMREO deflections in two tasks, one relying on free-field sounds and one presenting sounds in-ear. However, no analysis revealed any significant effect. Still, and in line with previous studies, we found that sound localization performance was dependent on the congruency of saccade and acoustic target directions. We conclude that either the eardrum does not move as directly reflected by the EMREO signal, or it does so, but the underlying changes at the tympanic membrane only have minimal perceptual impact.'
